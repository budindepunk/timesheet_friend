# timesheet_friend
Every Friday I get a calendar reminder to fill in my timesheet. This is annoying, because I do not keep tidy track of what I do during the week. For a while, I kept track in a little notebook, writing down everything I did (sorta) and (sorta) the time I did it for.
This was not ideal. And I thought: I wish my computer asked me every hour what I spent the last hour on. But not in a Big Brother way, more in a Letterboxd-obssessive-journaling way. And then I thought: that shouldn't be too hard to do, no?
So with the help of my sidekick Bing I set up to do just that, and this is what I came up with. I am not a developer and most of what I do is just to check if I can actually do it.

<h2><strong>Timesheet Friend üòåüëç </strong></h2></br>
<ol>
<li> The Friend will pop up once an hour to ask you what you've been up to (you need to set a cron job for this). </li>
<li> You will tell it (up to you whether you lie to it, it's not a snitch so there's no reason to but you do you). </li>
<li> It will log that in a .txt file named with the week number (I will try to make this better, maybe MONTH - week, but for now it's a number between 0 and  52). </li>
<li> On Fridays, you can check the week's file and clearly see what hours you have to lie about (the hour you spent playing Zelda under the desk, for example). </li>
